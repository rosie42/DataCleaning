# DataCleaning ReadMe

run_analysis.R is the only script required to produce the summary data set given the source data.

The working directory in R must point to the root folder of the source data (UCI HAR Dataset)
The data must also be in an extracted format, i.e., not in a zip folder.

The output of the script is the R data frame tidy_summary.
tidy_set is the tidy data used in the creation of tidy_summary.
